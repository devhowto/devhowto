== Introduction

TypeScript implements a _structural_ type system.
It means the names of types donâ€™t mater.
Only their shapes do.

For example, here's a type and a function that takes that type as parameter:

[source,typescript]
----
type Jedi = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

function printJedi(jedi: Jedi): void {
  log(jedi.id, jedi.name);
}

const ahsoka: Jedi = { id: 1, name: "Ahsoka Tano" };

// <1>
printJedi(ahsoka);

// <2>
printJedi({ id: 2, name: "Aayla Secura" });

----

<1> Type-checks because `ahsoka` is of type `Jedi`.

<2> Type-checks because even though we didn't explicitly create the object for Aayla by annotating it with the type `Jedi`, the type checker is satisfied with the the structure of the passed object.
Because it contains `id` of type `number`, and `name` of type `string`, the type checker is happy with it.

But as soon as the shape doesn't match, the type checker catches it:

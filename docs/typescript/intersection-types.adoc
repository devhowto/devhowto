== Introduction to Intersection Types

Intersection types are created with the `&` operator.
Intersections behaves different if used with literal types vs object types.
The `&` operator behaves like and _and_ operation for literal types, but as an _union_ for object types.

[source,typescript]
----
type T = string & number;
// type T = never
----

The resulting type is `never`, because `T` cannot possibly be both `string` *and* `number`.
In this case, the name “intersection” makes sense.
There is no intersection between `string` and `number`.

However, this creates an _union_ of the type constituents:

[source,typescript]
----
type U = BaseConfig & { headers: Record<string, string> };
// type U = BaseConfig & {
//     headers: Record<string, string>;
// }
----

It is as if we had done this:

[source,typescript]
----
type U = {
  url: string;
  version: number;
  headers: Record<string, string>;
}
----

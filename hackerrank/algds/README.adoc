== Intro

HackerRank has a track called _problem solving_ which is about algorithms:

* link:https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms[HackerRank algorithms and problem solving track^].

The page features many kinds of filters, like types of problems or difficulty.
We have chosen to group the solutions by difficulty:

* easy
* medium
* hard

The notes and source code contains tags (for grepping or searching somehow) which mentions the kind of topic covered in each challenge.
For example _array_, _collection_, _sort_, etc.
